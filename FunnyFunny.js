/*
FUNCTIONALITY: CREATES AN EXCEL FILE that 

indicates whether a person is on vacation, taking a day off, is on guard duty, or is present. 

The process should exclude(or minimize) a user's typing activity.

This means that there should be a GUI(mainly execution buttons) for reducing the user's redundant actions.
(by redundant actions, I mean inputting names, ranks, and status)

METHOD 1. 
Create an Excel program that edits a sheet.

METHOD 2.
Create a javascript program that prints out an html file with the same format as the Excel one.
